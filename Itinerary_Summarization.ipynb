Starting from either San Francisco, San Jose or Oakland, you’re looking at a 3.5 – 4.5 hour drive, depending on your exact starting point and traffic conditions.\\n\\nIt’s in your best interest to arrive to the park as early as possible, but as long as you arrive by late afternoon you’ll still be able to follow this itinerary. Stop by Tunnel View on your way into the park; it will be directly on your route if you’re taking the south entrance into the park, or is just a short detour away if you’re taking the north entrance.\\nAfter snapping a few photos and soaking in the sweeping scenery at Tunnel View, we continued on to Yosemite Valley Lodge and immediately checked into our room. We were eager to get the car parked and unpacked so we could start enjoying our long weekend in Yosemite!\\n\\nFrom the lodge, it was a short walk down the road to one of the valley’s easiest and most picturesque “hikes” – Cook’s Meadow. This flat, scenic 1-mile trail yields amazing views of Yosemite Falls and Half Dome right from the valley floor, and is the perfect way to get acquainted with the park.\\n\\nOn our way back to the lodge, we also did a quick stroll along the Lower Yosemite Falls trail.\\n\\nToday is the big day! You’ve got a full day to spend in Yosemite National Park, so let’s make the most of it. One of the very best ways to truly explore Yosemite is on your own two feet. We opted for the Upper Yosemite Falls Trail, mostly because the trailhead was a short walk down the road from our lodge. We were on the trail by 6:30am. By 1pm, we were back in the Yosemite Valley Lodge parking lot.\\n\\nAfter our strenuous hike the day before, it’s safe to say Derek and I weren’t up for any more physical activity. So instead, we opted for a scenic drive up to Glacier Point, home to some of the most dramatic views in all of Yosemite National Park.\\n\\nFrom way up here above the valley, you can gaze upon iconic sights like Half Dome and Yosemite Falls, and see all the way across to Yosemite’s high country. From Glacier Point, the drive home to San Jose took us around 4.5 hours through the park’s south entrance.\\n</td>\n",

If you’re not already familiar with travel in French Polynesia, it may surprise you to learn that most travelers see the island of Tahiti as nothing more than a jumping off point for exploring her sister islands, like Bora Bora, Moorea, Huahine, Tahaa and Maupiti.\\n\\nPape’ete was the first city we visited in French Polynesia that actually felt like a city. Although just 25,000 people call Pape’ete home, you’ll find traffic lights, multi-storied buildings and fast food—all characteristics that were completely nonexistent on the other islands we visited.\\n\\nPlan to spend around two hours exploring Downtown Pape’ete, where highlights include the charming, distinctly Polynesian Notre Dame Cathedral and the colorful Pape’ete Town Hall. No visit to Pape’ete would be complete without strolling through the bustling Pape’ete Market!\\n\\nOnce you’ve had your fill of Pape’ete, hop in your rental car and get ready for a mini road-trip around Tahiti! We passed several quaint churches, surfing beaches, and small-but-bustling towns. To our left, the mountainous heart of the island remained utterly wild, rugged and impenetrable.\\n\\nOur first true sightseeing stop of the day was Taharuu Beach, which is renowned for its volcanic black sands. After soaking in the views (and devouring the ice cream) at Taharuu, we piled back in the car and continued on our way down the road. Just 15 minutes later, we stumbled across yet another of the day’s highlights: the Water Gardens of Vaipahi. From the water gardens, we continued on until we reached the Isthmus of Taravao—a narrow strip of land that connects the larger Tahiti Nui to the smaller Tahiti Iti.\\n\\nThere actually isn’t a single road that circles all of Tahiti Iti; you can choose to follow the southern coast towards Teahupo’o, or the northern coast towards Tautira. Either way, the road will eventually come to a dead end, and you’ll have no choice but to turn around and head back the same way. We opted to follow the road to Tautira, a laid-back surfing community at the end of the paved road. Despite its small size and remote location, Tautira has hosted a number of famed explorers, including Captain James Cook and novelist Robert Louis Stevenson.\\n\\nFrom Tahiti Iti, we made our way back north towards Pape’ete, along the western coast of Tahiti Nui. Just before reaching Pape’ete you’ll pass the Arahoho Blowhole and the famous Point Venus Lighthouse. Half an hour later, and you’re back in bustling Pape’ete!</td>\n",

But regardless of where you’re staying on the island, this is one area of Moorea you don’t want to miss; the palm-fringed shorelines and dramatic, craggy mountain peaks are like something straight out Moana! Be sure to see the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, which is as cute as can be.\\nThe second of Moorea’s twin bays is no less impressive than the first; in fact, Opunohu Bay has even fewer developments and more untouched shorelines than Cook’s Bay. Additionally, it was actually here that the famous explorer Captain James Cook anchored in 1777.\\n\\nWind your way through dense forest and past ancient Polynesian temples to this viewpoint, where you’ll be rewarded with stunning views of Mount Rotui. Located along the road leading to the Belvedere are two marae (ancient temples) known as Marae Titiroa and Marae Ahu-o-Mahine. Continuing back down the same road from the Belvedere, you will reach a crossroads where you can turn right onto the Pineapple Route. Pull off to the side of the road to snap a photo of Eglise de la Sainte Famille in the little town of Ha’apiti. We returned after dinner.\\n\\nVisiting the Juice Factory for a tasting is one of the most popular activities on Moorea, especially if you get unlucky with a rainy day. The tasting experience is pretty quick. Then, it’s time to hit the beach yet again! Mareto Beach (also known as Ta’ahiamanu Beach) is one of the most scenic, most popular public beaches on Moorea.\\nIf you’re the type who can’t sit still for too long, you could use this evening to book a sunset sailing excursion or attend a luau at the Tiki Village Cultural Center.\\n</td>\n",

And while the seaside city of Puerto Vallarta may be the most well-known getaway destination in Jalisco, there’s a better option if you’re looking to experience the true heart, soul, and culture of this region: Guadalajara. Guadalajara Cathedral, this historic icon of the city was originally built in the mid-1500s, although repairs were made to the towers in the 1800s. Surrounding the cathedral are four separate plazas, known collectively as the Cross of Plazas. These include: Plaza de Armas (South), Plaza Guadalajara (West), Rotunda of Illustrious Jaliscienses (North), and Plaza de la Liberación (East).\\n\\nOn the opposite side of Plaza de la Liberación from the Guadalajara Cathedral you’ll find the magnificent Teatro Degollado. To the southeast of the Guadalajara Cathedral and visible from the Plaza de Armas sits the main government building for the state of Jalisco. While a governor’s office may not sound like the most exciting attraction, housed inside are two larger-than-life murals by José Clemente Orozco, one of Mexico’s most renowned painters.\\n\\nAlright guys, here’s the big one. According to the guidebooks (and me), if you only have time to do ONE thing in Guadalajara, it had better be this.

We landed at Miami international airport later at night and went directly to our shared Airbnb. We pretty much. stayed home that night and planned for our next moring. Our tour started with the Miami south point beach on our map. However, on our way, we took a stop at the crandon beach park and trust me, it was the best spot that I still remember from that tour. If I ever go back there I will happily reserve one whole day to enjoy the soft sunrise and how the first ray of sun kisses those tall buildings, I will cycle alongside the beach and finally enjoy a sunset that creates an unwordly effect there. South point beach was also good. We rented a tricylce and enjoyed strolling around it. We are not much of a place checklist couple and we kept it simple with these two beaches only on our first day. We covered the colorful city the next day, Wynwood Walls  and little Havanna. It was new years eve and we celebrated the night at Bayside Marketplace. This place overwhelmes with lively people at this time of the year. If you visit Miami to celebrate new year, never miss this place. Fourth day started. How can we call it a Miami tour if we've not visited the Key West or southernmost point, right? You need to reserve one entire day for this place. Take small stops and enjoy being surrounded by the sea on every ends. We also visited the Dolphin Research Centre before hitting the southernmost point of the US. Thre dream tour almost ended for us with the KeyWest, but destiny had something else planned for us. We missed our return flight to NC States and got one extra day. We visited the Haulover beach in the morning. This beach had a lot of similarity with the Miami south point beach except it was more private. Our airbnb for that night was near Ford Lauderdale and it was a plus for us as well. Unintentionally, by that time, we had coverd almost all the beaches. If you like to have a city vibe alongside a beach, Ford Lauderdale should be your first option.</td>\n",

We stopped just twice more along the way: once at Lindis Pass Lookout, and again at Peter’s Lookout near Lake Pukaki.\\n\\nLindis Pass actually reminded me a bit of California! The landscape was incredibly brown, and the hills were quite low and rolling. It’s a good place to stretch your legs and take a break from driving, but our stop here was short, as there’s not too much to see.\\n\\nFrom here, it’s only around 35 minutes more to Mount Cook Village—and the views get a whole lot more epic with each passing mile.\\n\\nWe completed the Hooker Valley Track early in the morning during our second day in the park; we were on the trail by 7:00am, and wrapped up our hike before 10:30am.\\n\\nLater that afternoon, we also completed the Tasman Glacier View Walk.

Starting from either San Francisco, San Jose or Oakland, you’re looking at a 3.5 – 4.5 hour drive, depending on your exact starting point and traffic conditions.\\n\\nIt’s in your best interest to arrive to the park as early as possible, but as long as you arrive by late afternoon you’ll still be able to follow this itinerary. Stop by Tunnel View on your way into the park; it will be directly on your route if you’re taking the south entrance into the park, or is just a short detour away if you’re taking the north entrance.\\nAfter snapping a few photos and soaking in the sweeping scenery at Tunnel View, we continued on to Yosemite Valley Lodge and immediately checked into our room. We were eager to get the car parked and unpacked so we could start enjoying our long weekend in Yosemite!\\n\\nFrom the lodge, it was a short walk down the road to one of the valley’s easiest and most picturesque “hikes” – Cook’s Meadow. This flat, scenic 1-mile trail yields amazing views of Yosemite Falls and Half Dome right from the valley floor, and is the perfect way to get acquainted with the park.\\n\\nOn our way back to the lodge, we also did a quick stroll along the Lower Yosemite Falls trail.\\n\\nToday is the big day! You’ve got a full day to spend in Yosemite National Park, so let’s make the most of it. One of the very best ways to truly explore Yosemite is on your own two feet. We opted for the Upper Yosemite Falls Trail, mostly because the trailhead was a short walk down the road from our lodge. We were on the trail by 6:30am. By 1pm, we were back in the Yosemite Valley Lodge parking lot.\\n\\nAfter our strenuous hike the day before, it’s safe to say Derek and I weren’t up for any more physical activity. So instead, we opted for a scenic drive up to Glacier Point, home to some of the most dramatic views in all of Yosemite National Park.\\n\\nFrom way up here above the valley, you can gaze upon iconic sights like Half Dome and Yosemite Falls, and see all the way across to Yosemite’s high country. From Glacier Point, the drive home to San Jose took us around 4.5 hours through the park’s south entrance.\\n                                                                                                                                                                         Enter into Yosemite National Park\\nStop by Tunnel View.\\nShort walk down the road to Cook's Meadow\\nStroll along the lower Yoselimte Falls Trail\\nHike Upper Yosemite Falls Trail\\nDrive up to Glacier Point\\nGaze upon Half Dome\n",
              "2   Tahiti is among the most famous and iconic of French Polynesia’s 67 inhabited islands; the name alone conjures images of palm trees dancing in a warm island breeze, and mai tais being sipped in the moonlight. If you’re not already familiar with travel in French Polynesia, it may surprise you to learn that most travelers see the island of Tahiti as nothing more than a jumping off point for exploring her sister islands, like Bora Bora, Moorea, Huahine, Tahaa and Maupiti.\\n\\nPape’ete was the first city we visited in French Polynesia that actually felt like a city. Although just 25,000 people call Pape’ete home, you’ll find traffic lights, multi-storied buildings and fast food—all characteristics that were completely nonexistent on the other islands we visited.\\n\\nPlan to spend around two hours exploring Downtown Pape’ete, where highlights include the charming, distinctly Polynesian Notre Dame Cathedral and the colorful Pape’ete Town Hall. No visit to Pape’ete would be complete without strolling through the bustling Pape’ete Market!\\n\\nOnce you’ve had your fill of Pape’ete, hop in your rental car and get ready for a mini road-trip around Tahiti! We passed several quaint churches, surfing beaches, and small-but-bustling towns. To our left, the mountainous heart of the island remained utterly wild, rugged and impenetrable.\\n\\nOur first true sightseeing stop of the day was Taharuu Beach, which is renowned for its volcanic black sands. After soaking in the views (and devouring the ice cream) at Taharuu, we piled back in the car and continued on our way down the road. Just 15 minutes later, we stumbled across yet another of the day’s highlights: the Water Gardens of Vaipahi. From the water gardens, we continued on until we reached the Isthmus of Taravao—a narrow strip of land that connects the larger Tahiti Nui to the smaller Tahiti Iti.\\n\\nThere actually isn’t a single road that circles all of Tahiti Iti; you can choose to follow the southern coast towards Teahupo’o, or the northern coast towards Tautira. Either way, the road will eventually come to a dead end, and you’ll have no choice but to turn around and head back the same way. We opted to follow the road to Tautira, a laid-back surfing community at the end of the paved road. Despite its small size and remote location, Tautira has hosted a number of famed explorers, including Captain James Cook and novelist Robert Louis Stevenson.\\n\\nFrom Tahiti Iti, we made our way back north towards Pape’ete, along the western coast of Tahiti Nui. Just before reaching Pape’ete you’ll pass the Arahoho Blowhole and the famous Point Venus Lighthouse.

We based ourselves in Cook’s Bay, so this was our starting point for the day. But regardless of where you’re staying on the island, this is one area of Moorea you don’t want to miss; the palm-fringed shorelines and dramatic, craggy mountain peaks are like something straight out Moana! Be sure to see the Saint Joseph Catholic Church, which is as cute as can be.\\nThe second of Moorea’s twin bays is no less impressive than the first; in fact, Opunohu Bay has even fewer developments and more untouched shorelines than Cook’s Bay. Additionally, it was actually here that the famous explorer Captain James Cook anchored in 1777.\\n\\nWind your way through dense forest and past ancient Polynesian temples to this viewpoint, where you’ll be rewarded with stunning views of Mount Rotui. Located along the road leading to the Belvedere are two marae (ancient temples) known as Marae Titiroa and Marae Ahu-o-Mahine. Continuing back down the same road from the Belvedere, you will reach a crossroads where you can turn right onto the Pineapple Route. Pull off to the side of the road to snap a photo of Eglise de la Sainte Famille in the little town of Ha’apiti. We returned after dinner.\\n\\nVisiting the Juice Factory for a tasting is one of the most popular activities on Moorea, especially if you get unlucky with a rainy day. The tasting experience is pretty quick. Then, it’s time to hit the beach yet again! Mareto Beach (also known as Ta’ahiamanu Beach) is one of the most scenic, most popular public beaches on Moorea.\\nIf you’re the type who can’t sit still for too long, you could use this evening to book a sunset sailing excursion or attend a luau at the Tiki Village Cultural Center.\\n  Start from Cook's Bay\\nSee the Saint Joseph Catholic Church\\nSee Opunohu Bay\\nView Mount Rotui\\nStop by Marae Titiroa \\nStop by Marae Ahu-o-Mahine\\nContinue back down from Belvedere\\nTurn into Pineapple Route\\nSnap photo of Eglise de la Sainte Famille in the little town of Ha’apiti\\nVisit Juice Factory\\nVisit Mareto Beach/Ta’ahiamanu Beach\\nAttend a luau at the Tiki Village Cultural Center\n",

And while the seaside city of Puerto Vallarta may be the most well-known getaway destination in Jalisco, there’s a better option if you’re looking to experience the true heart, soul, and culture of this region: Guadalajara. Guadalajara Cathedral, this historic icon of the city was originally built in the mid-1500s, although repairs were made to the towers in the 1800s. Surrounding the cathedral are four separate plazas, known collectively as the Cross of Plazas. These include: Plaza de Armas (South), Plaza Guadalajara (West), Rotunda of Illustrious Jaliscienses (North), and Plaza de la Liberación (East).\\n\\nOn the opposite side of Plaza de la Liberación from the Guadalajara Cathedral you’ll find the magnificent Teatro Degollado. To the southeast of the Guadalajara Cathedral and visible from the Plaza de Armas sits the main government building for the state of Jalisco. While a governor’s office may not sound like the most exciting attraction, housed inside are two larger-than-life murals by José Clemente Orozco, one of Mexico’s most renowned painters.\\n\\nAlright guys, here’s the big one. According to the guidebooks (and me), if you only have time to do ONE thing in Guadalajara, it had better be this. The Hospicio Cabañas was one of the oldest and largest hospital complexes in the Americas, originally founded in 1791. To get to the Templo Expiatorio del Santísimo Sacramento, you’ll need to walk about a mile and half from Hospico Cabañas, backtracking past the Guadalajara Cathedral along the way.\\n                               Experience Guadalajara\\nVisit Guadalajara Cathedral\\nVisit Cross of Plaza (Plaza de Armas (South), Plaza Guadalajara (West), Rotunda of Illustrious Jaliscienses (North), and Plaza de la Liberación (East)\\nFind Teatro Degollado\\nVisit main government building for the state of Jalisco\\nVisit Hospicio Cabañas\\nWalk to the Templo Expiatorio del Santísimo Sacramento\n",

We landed at Miami international airport later at night and went directly to our shared Airbnb. We pretty much. stayed home that night and planned for our next moring. Our tour started with the Miami south point beach on our map. However, on our way, we took a stop at the crandon beach park and trust me, it was the best spot that I still remember from that tour. If I ever go back there I will happily reserve one whole day to enjoy the soft sunrise and how the first ray of sun kisses those tall buildings, I will cycle alongside the beach and finally enjoy a sunset that creates an unwordly effect there. South point beach was also good. We rented a tricylce and enjoyed strolling around it. We are not much of a place checklist couple and we kept it simple with these two beaches only on our first day. We covered the colorful city the next day, Wynwood Walls  and little Havanna. It was new years eve and we celebrated the night at Bayside Marketplace. This place overwhelmes with lively people at this time of the year. If you visit Miami to celebrate new year, never miss this place. Fourth day started. How can we call it a Miami tour if we've not visited the Key West or southernmost point, right? You need to reserve one entire day for this place. Take small stops and enjoy being surrounded by the sea on every ends. We also visited the Dolphin Research Centre before hitting the southernmost point of the US. Thre dream tour almost ended for us with the KeyWest, but destiny had something else planned for us. We missed our return flight to NC States and got one extra day. We visited the Haulover beach in the morning. This beach had a lot of similarity with the Miami south point beach except it was more private. Our airbnb for that night was near Ford Lauderdale and it was a plus for us as well. Unintentionally, by that time, we had coverd almost all the beaches. If you like to have a city vibe alongside a beach, Ford Lauderdale should be your first option.

Start off with City Palace which is an epitome of the architecture of royal Mewar family. This palace actually took nearly 300 years to get totally completed. Maharaja Udai Singh II began the construction and then the subsequent Mewari rulers added many structures into it Inside the palace, you’ll find a museum which displays the exquisite things from the long gone era of Rajputs. Built out of marble and granite somewhat like Amber Fort, city palace offers a spectacular view. I could also see the Pichola Lake from there which was adding a mesmerizing beauty to its splendorous view. We took a detour to this lake on our way to our hotel on the first day.

Truly, the name is worth of its beauty.

Harley Farms Goat Dairy was the first stop during our day trip to Pescadero. There’s not a whole lot going on in downtown Pescadero, but that’s exactly what makes it so darn charming. Bean Hollow State Beach and Pescadero State Beach are two of the most highly rated beaches near Pescadero. Pigeon Point Lighthouse is Pescadero’s most famous landmark, and with very good reason! Just a few miles south down Highway 1 is one of the sweetest spots to visit in Pescadero: Pie Ranch Farm Stand. You’ll know you’ve found the right place when you start seeing the hand-painted “slow down for pie” signs along the road!\\nWhere do you go from here? The world—er, highway—is your oyster! Roll down the windows, feel the wind in your hair, smell the sea breeze, take note of the farmlands pressed up against the rocky coastline, pull off to the side of the road when a particular viewpoint grabs your attention…and just relish the sheer beauty of Highway 1.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                       Stop by Harley Farms Goat Dairy\\nGo to downtown Pescadero\\nVisit Bean Hollow State Beach and Pescadero State Beach\\nStop by Pigeon Point Lighthouse\\nViist Pie Ranch Farm Stand\\nDrive on Highway 1\n",

It’s located less than one hour by car from cities like San Jose and San Francisco, yet feels a world away from the hustle and bustle of Silicon Valley.\\n\\nHalf Moon Bay is a small place, so you truly can experience the best it has to offer in a single day. Half Moon Bay’s small downtown area is the perfect spot to get acquainted with this quiet coastal town. At just a few blocks long, you won’t need much time to stroll the entire of length of Main Street. There are a few historic points of interest located in and near downtown Half Moon Bay as well, including the teeny Half Moon Bay Jail and the beautifully restored Johnston House.\\n\\nHalf Moon Bay State Beach is actually a state park that encompasses four distinct beaches: Francis Beach, Venice Beach, Dunes Beach and Roosevelt Beach. This four-mile stretch of wide, sandy shoreline is known for its crescent shape and dramatic bluffs.\\n\\nTrust me when I say there is no better spot in Half Moon Bay for sipping a cocktail and watching the sun set over the Pacific Ocean than the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay.\\n\\nYou don’t need to stay at the hotel in order to experience its gorgeous outdoor dining space, The Ocean Terrace. Drinks and appetizers are pricey, but it’s well worth it for the views of the majestic cliffs and crashing waves.\\n\\nThe combination of lush, perfectly landscaped golf course plus rugged coastline honestly makes me feel as if I’ve been transported to Ireland or Scotland…and I suppose the Ritz agrees, given their beloved sunset bagpiper ritual!\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Visit Half Moon Bay\\nStroll Main Street\\nVisit Half Moon Bay Jail and Johnston House\\nStop by Half Moon Bay State Beach, Francis Beach, Venice Beach, Dunes Beach and Roosevelt Beach\\n\n",

Best of all, Big Sur is a place where you can choose your own adventure. Once you reach the area around Monterey and Carmel, you’ll be treated to incredible ocean scenery as you continue your drive. One of the first landmarks you’ll pass as you make your way south towards Big Sur is Bixby Creek Bridge. Continuing along Highway 1, located between Nepethne and Deetjen’s Big Sur Inn is the Henry Miller Memorial Library. As you near Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park, prepare to pull over to see the iconic McWay Falls.\\n\\nThen, it’s time to get acquainted with the activity that Big Sur is best known for: hiking! We decided to hike the Bluffs Trail in Andrew Molera State Park. Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park offers a number of shorter trails, while Limekiln State Park allows a leisurely 0.5-mile walk. Personally, I don’t consider Big Sur a traditionally “beachy” location. But yes, there are beaches there: Pfeiffer Beach and Sand Dollar Beach.\\n                                                                                         Reach around Monterey and Carmel\\nPass by Bixby Creek Bridge\\nContinue along Highway 1\\nVisit Henry Miller Memorial Library\\nStop by Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Park\\nSee McWay Falls\\nHike the Bluffs Trail in Andrew Molera State Park\\nWalk in Limekiln State Park\\nVisit Pfeiffer Beach and Sand Dollar Beach\n",

It was more like a street party or festival than a farmer’s market, really!\\n\\nBeing the foodies that we are, we decided to dedicate our first full day in San Luis Obispo to discovering its many culinary offerings. We spent a while just roaming up and down Higuera Street. we made our way towards the Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa, which conveniently enough is also located just off Higuera Street. Did you know that San Luis Obispo County is actually the third largest wine region in all of California? It’s split into two distinct areas: Paso Robles and Edna Valley. \\n\\nLast full day in San Luis Obispo, you can go to Hike Bishop’s Peak, which is a 3.5 mile roundtrip trail with sweeping views of San Luis Obispo County, especially the city itself. Visit nearby Morro Bay. Walk along the shore, see the iconic Morro Rock, and if the weather is nice, try some kayaking or stand-up paddle boarding. Venture into Bubblegum Alley - this quirky, colorful, and – depending on your viewpoint – disgusting attraction in downtown. \\n                                                                                        Enjoy Thursday night farmer’s market – one of San Luis Obispo’s star attractions\\nRoam up and down Higuera Street\\nMade your way towards Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa\\nVisit Paso Robles and Edna Valley\\nHike Bishop's Peak\\nVisit nearby Morro Bay\\nSee the iconic Morro Rock\\nVenture into Bubblegum Alley\n",

It’s a city with interesting stories to be told, beautiful sights to be seen, and incredible food, wine and beer to be enjoyed. After breakfast, hop in the car and drive just a mile up the road towards San Jose’s Rose Garden neighborhood. Next there’s Winchester Mystery House. There’s no denying that there’s something a bit unsettling about the infamous Winchester mansion! Conveniently located just across the street from the Winchester Mansion is Santana Row, one of San Jose’s most scenic and iconic shopping streets.\\n\\nBreakfast? Done. Sightseeing? Done. Shopping? Done. Now, it’s time to drink! Who needs to make the two hour trek north to Napa or Sonoma when you’ve got the beautiful Santa Cruz Mountain wine region just 30 minutes south of downtown San Jose? After a long afternoon of boozing your way through Santa Cruz Mountain wineries, you’ll likely be ready to dig into some delicious local cuisine.

Old City is the heart and soul of ancient Shanghai, and one of the best places to get a taste of the city’s history and culture. There are City God Temple, Chenxiang Ge Temple, Old City Wall (Dajing Tower), and Baiyun Guan (White Cloud) Temple, among others. When you’re ready to escape the crowds of Shanghai’s Old City, make your way to the small pond located just outside the gates of Yu Garden. There, you’ll find an ornate, classically-designed teahouse perched on stilts above the water. Leading towards the teahouse across the pond is the famously zig-zagging Jiu Qu Qiao Bridge, which is said to provide protection against evil spirits. Huxinting teahouse is the oldest and most famous teahouse in all of Shanghai. Next up is the spot that many consider to be the true “heart” of Shanghai: People’s Square. If you visit on a Saturday or Sunday, you’ll be able to witness a rare and intriguing phenomenon: the Shanghai Marriage Market. Adjacent to People’s Park and People’s Square is the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Center. \\n\\nThis pedestrian street (one of the largest in the world!) conveniently runs from People’s Square to the Bund, so you might as well make this your next stop.\\n\\nNanjing East Road is popular shopping street, with a massive variety of stores and outlets to explore. You’ll also find an abundance of food on Nanjing, from small street stalls to busy restaurants.

Marienplatz is the heart, soul, and lifeblood of Munich. Ask any traveler to conjure up a mental image of Marienplatz and it’s likely you’ll get the same result every time: New Town Hall. This massive, ornate, Gothic building towers over Marienplatz is home to the the uber-famous tourist attraction, the Rathaus Glockenspiel. You can also take the lift up to the top of the New Town Hall tower, where you can gaze upon panoramic views of Munich, including views of one of Marienplatz’s other big architectural and historic sights: Old Town Hall. From the top of New Town Hall, you can also see St. Peter’s Church, the oldest church in Munich. St. Michael’s and St. Johann Nepomuk are both located very close (just a short walk) to Marienplatz. Next, we found Viktualienmarkt food market, conveniently located behind St. Peter’s Church. If you’re looking for something with a little more shade and relaxation than the food market but with just as much character, then I’ve got a treat for you: Asamhof Passage. If you’re looking for a cold drink to wash down your hearty German food after a long day of sightseeing, there’s really only one option: Hofbräuhaus.\\n\\nIf you’re willing to walk just a tad further, you’ll find yourself at the former royal palace of the House of Wittelsbach: the Munich Residenz.

Enjoy the Views from Kamerlengo Castle, which is a 14th century fortress. \\n\\nThe waterfront promenade may be the true heartbeat of Trogir, but the square near St. Lawrence Cathedral is a close runner-up.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Visit Trogir's waterfront promenade\\nExplore the Maze of Marble Streets \\nEnjoy the Views from Kamerlengo Castle\\nVisit St. Lawrence Cathedral\n",

Explore El Poblado/Parque Lleras. Riding in the cable car and gazing down at Medellin’s poorest neighborhoods offers a stark contrast to the city center. I got off at the Santo Domingo stop to look around for a bit, but eventually decided to continue my journey upwards towards Parque Arvi. I had heard about the free walking tour from Real City Tours before I even arrived in Medellin. The tour brings you to places like Plaza Botero, Alpujarra Administrative Centre, Plaza Cisneros (Plaza of Lights), Parque Bolivar, Parque Berrio, Carabobo Pedestrian Walkway, Veracruz Church, and National Palace (now converted into a shopping mall). There’re some other most popular sights and activities: Jardin Botanico, Parque Explora, and Pueblito Paisa.\\n                                                   Explore El Poblado/Parque Lleras\\nGet off at the Santo Domingo stop to look around for a bit\\nContinue journey upwards towards Parque Arvi\\nWalk in Medellin\\nStop by Plaza Botero, Alpujarra Administrative Centre, Plaza Cisneros (Plaza of Lights), Parque Bolivar, Parque Berrio, Carabobo Pedestrian Walkway, Veracruz Church, and National Palace\n",

The Torre Latinoamericana opens at 9am, and it costs 80 pesos to take the elevator (plus some stairs) to the mirador located at the top of the tower. While looking north from the Torre Latinoamericana, you’ll spot an elegant white building to the right of a rectangular green park. This building is the Palacio de Bellas Artes, or the Palace of Fine Arts. Next door to it, there’s Alameda Park, which has been gracing Mexico City with its beauty since the late 1500’s. After admiring the Palace of Fine Arts and strolling around Alameda, head back towards the Torre Latinoamericana and walk east down either Av. Juarez or Av. 5 de Mayo. Here, you’ll find the stunning Casa de los Azulejos, or “House of Tiles.”\\n\\nAh, the Zocalo, also known as the Plaza de la Constitución. This square is truly the heart of Mexico City! The city’s most important historical and architectural sites are located here, including the Palacio Nacional, the Catedral Metropolitana, and the Templo Mayor. The Metropolitan Cathedral may just have been my favorite of the city’s surprises.

It’s often looped in with the nearby neighborhood Roma, and together the region is frequently called “Roma and Condesa” or “Condesa and Roma.” Chapultepec Park is located just west of Condesa & Roma, and all three neighborhoods are within walking distance of each other. As much as I loved Parque Mexico, I’m honestly not sure any park in the world can compete with Bosque de Chapultepec (literally “Chapultepec Forest,” commonly referred to as Chapultepec Park). Thought of as the “lungs” of Mexico City, this park is home to nine museums and countless sculptures, fountains, and gardens.\\nTucked away on the far eastern side of Chapultepec Park is one of my favorite Mexico City attractions: Castillo de Chapultepec, or Chapultepec Castle.\\nMexico City’s Museum of Anthropology is about to blow you away.

They have this idea about Kashmir being always in a state of war. however, we were adamant to visit this heaven of the earth. With our hopes high, we reached the Kolkata Intl Airport from Dhaka where the immigration officer enlightened us about a recent incident in Kashmir and suggested us to visit somewhere else in India. We decided to go to Delhi from there without knowing where to go next. Our kind Uber driver took us to our Hotel at Delhi. We wanted to make the most out of our tour and hence decided to visit the beautiful architechtural places in Delhi starting with The Red Fort, Humayun's tomb and finally the India gate. These places were all beautiful but something was still missing in our heart. Stuck with the huge map of India and the little money that we have left, a place named Rishikesh, Uttarakhand popped up from nowhere. It met all our criteria: \"fun, adventure, nature and cost effective\". We started straight north towards Rishikesh camping site. River Rafting on the rapids of Ganga River is one of the most adventurous sports in Rishikesh. We camped there for an entire day and covered rafting, cliff jumping the next day. This sums up our entire little adventure tour. We were four happy hearts, thankful for our life the way it was and returned back home with our parents' favorite haldiram sweets. They still don't know that it came straight from India.

I visited the world-famous active volcano Gunung Api and went for a swim in Natsepa beach from there. I forgot to mention about the traditional market in Ambon that fall on the way to the Natsepa beach. You can definitely stop by there if you love to know about the stories behind traditional spices and how it because famous in that place.

We stop just twice more along the way : once at Lindis Pass Lookout , and again at Peter ’ s Lookout near Lake Pukaki . Lindis Pass actually remind me a bit of California ! The landscape be incredibly brown , and the hill be quite low and roll . It ’ s a good place to stretch your leg and take a break from drive , but our stop here be short , as there ’ s not too much to see . From here , it ’ s only around 35 minute more to Mount Cook Village—and the view get a whole lot more epic with each pass mile . We complete the Hooker Valley Track early in the morning during our second day in the park ; we be on the trail by 7:00am , and wrap up our hike before 10:30am . Later that afternoon , we also complete the Tasman Glacier View Walk ."
